# this diractory. By default, the operating directory feature is turned off.
# set operatingdir "directory"

# Preserve the XON and XOFF keys (^Q and ^S).

# Set the characters treated as closing punctuation when justifying paragraphs.

# The email-quote string, used to justify email-quoted paragraphs. This is an
# extended regular expression if your system supports them, otherwise a
# literal string. The default value is "^([ \t]*[#:>\|}])+" if you have
# extended regular expression support, or "> " otherwise. Note that '\t'
# stands for a literal Tab character.

# properly. You should only need to use this option if Backspace acts like
# Delete on your system.
unset rebinddelete

# only need to use this option if they don't, as mouse support won't work
# properly with this option enabled.

unset regexp

# Make the Home key smarter. When Home is pressed anywhere but at the very
# beginning of non-whitespace characters on a line, the cursor will jump to that
